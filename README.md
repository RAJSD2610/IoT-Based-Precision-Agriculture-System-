Constructed a Wireless Sensor Networks consisting of Atmega 328 microcontroller and Raspberry pi processor, using Xbee S2 transceivers to automatically monitor and control the environment of the crop. Programmed the Xbee S2 using XCTU software to adhere to the hierarchy of one root node and other leaf nodes. Developed sensor - actuator system to measure and control environmental conditions. Used apache server, php and html script with the Raspberry pi to act as the border router to host the webpage.Programmed Raspberry pi using python.
